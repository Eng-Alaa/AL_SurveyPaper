ALUncertaintyBehaviourANalysis_binary: This file shows the contour plots of the entropy, least confident, and smallest margin samling methods, and how with binary data, all these methods select the same point, while each of them gives different uncertainty value

ALUncertaintyBehaviourANalysis_Multiple: This file shows the contour plots of the entropy, least confident, and smallest margin samling methods, and how with multple data, these methods select the different points because each of them gives different uncertainty values to the instance space or the unlabeled data

ClassProbabilitiesExampleDetails: This is an example to show how the logistic regression classifier produces not only class labels, but also class probabilities

ClassProbabilitiesExample: This is like the previous example, but less details.


Uncertainty_Evidence_Binary: This explains how the evidence-based uncertainty is calculated. In the papers, the evidence-based always select from S (selected set of points). In this file we used the original evidence-based method that selects from the best five points and also select from the whole pool and show the difference.


Uncertainty_Evidence_Numerical: This explains how the evidence-based uncertainty is calculated using a toy dataset.

CredalUncertainty_AL: This shows how the Credal-based uncertainty is calculated and employed to find uncertian points to query points in active learning
