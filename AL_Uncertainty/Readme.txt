ALUncertaintyBehaviourANalysis_binary: This file shows the contour plots of the entropy, least confident, and smallest margin samling methods, and how with binary data, all these methods select the same point, while each of them gives different uncertainty value

ALUncertaintyBehaviourANalysis_Multiple: This file shows the contour plots of the entropy, least confident, and smallest margin samling methods, and how with multple data, these methods select the different points because each of them gives different uncertainty values to the instance space or the unlabeled data
